Example command when creating bindings:

htod /c/devLibs/gdal21/include/gdal_version.h ./gdal_version.d -I/c/dm/include

This assumes that you have htod and Digital Mars C compiler installed.
I run this command from the PFBd/source/gdal/original folder. Then you can do
a diff with the original files in that folder to see the changes there and 
therefore what changes are needed in the bindings.
